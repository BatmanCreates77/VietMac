# 🔴 LIVE Prices Integration - Complete

## ✅ What Was Changed

Updated the UI to prominently display **LIVE scraped prices** vs estimated prices.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **API Updates** (`app/api/[[...path]]/route.js`)

#### Simplified Product Transformation
- Removed complex spec parsing
- Now uses original product names from scrapers
- Preserves shop information
- Marks products with `scraped: true` flag

#### Prioritized Live Data
- **NEW:** Scraped products shown FIRST (top priority)
- Fallback products only shown if no scraped equivalent exists
- This ensures live prices are always visible

#### Enhanced API Response
```javascript
{
  "source": "🔴 LIVE Prices (84 products) + Market Estimates",
  "scrapedProductsCount": 84,
  "lastScraped": "2025-10-09T01:15:17.000Z"
}
```

---

### 2. **UI Updates** (`components/ui/macbook-prices-table.jsx`)

#### Added LIVE Badge
```jsx
{item.scraped && (
  <Badge className="bg-red-500 text-white animate-pulse">
    🔴 LIVE
  </Badge>
)}
```

#### Updated Price Label
- **Live prices:** "🔴 Live Price" (red, bold)
- **Estimates:** "Est. Price" (gray, normal)

#### Visual Indicators
- 🔴 Pulsing red "LIVE" badge next to shop name
- Red text for live price labels
- Clear distinction between real and estimated prices

---

## 🎯 Result

### Before
- All prices shown as "Est. Price"
- No way to tell real vs estimated
- Hardcoded fallback prices mixed with scraped

### After
- **84 LIVE prices** clearly marked with 🔴 badge
- Live prices shown at top of each shop
- "🔴 Live Price" label for scraped data
- "Est. Price" for fallback data
- API response shows count of live products

---

## 📊 Live Price Coverage

| Shop | Live Products | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|

| **ShopDunk** | 44 products | ✅ LIVE |

# MacBook Scraping Results & Data Collection Strategy

## Executive Summary

After testing automated scraping on all 4 Vietnamese MacBook retailers, we've identified significant challenges with anti-bot protection. This document outlines our findings and recommends a hybrid approach for data collection.

---

## Scraping Test Results

### 1. **FPT Shop** (fptshop.com.vn)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Issue:** HTTP 403 Forbidden + Cloudflare protection
- **Blocking Method:** WAF (Web Application Firewall) + Anti-bot
- **Data Availability:** Unknown (blocked before content load)
- **Recommendation:** Manual data entry OR API reverse engineering

### 2. **ShopDunk** (shopdunk.com)
- **Status:** ✅ Partial Success
- **Products Found:** 78 MacBook listings detected
- **Data Extractable:**
  - ✅ Product names
  - ✅ Prices (though format needs cleaning)
  - ✅ Product URLs
  - ✅ Product IDs
- **Issues:** 
  - Network idle timeout (slow JS execution)
  - Some prices show as "Giảm 43%" (discount %) instead of actual price
  - Mix of new and refurbished products
- **Recommendation:** Scraping feasible with longer timeouts + better price extraction

### 3. **TopZone** (topzone.vn)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Issue:** Connection timeout (network level blocking)
- **Blocking Method:** Aggressive rate limiting or geo-blocking
- **Data Availability:** Unknown
- **Recommendation:** Manual data entry OR VPN/proxy required

### 4. **CellphoneS** (cellphones.com.vn)
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Products Found:** 20 MacBook Pro + MacBook Air listings
- **Data Extractable:**
  - ✅ Product names (full specs in title)
  - ✅ Product URLs (direct links)
  - ⚠️ Prices (found but selector needs refinement)
  - ✅ Product images
- **Issues:** None major, standard HTML structure
- **Recommendation:** Fully scrapable, easiest target

## What UI Data Can We Get?

### Available Data (from successful scrapes)

#### ShopDunk Extract Sample:
```json
{
  "model": "MacBook Air 13.6 inch M3 | 8 core CPU | 8 core GPU | 8GB RAM | SSD 256GB",
  "price_text": "Giảm 43%",
  "product_id": "4677",
  "url": "https://shopdunk.com/macbook-air-136-inch-m3-8-core-cpu-8-core-gpu-8gb-ram-ssd-256gb-cu-dep-du-hop-pk"
}
```

#### CellphoneS Extract Sample:
```json
{
  "model": "MacBook Pro 14 M4 10CPU 10GPU 16GB 512GB | Chính hãng Apple Việt Nam",
  "url": "https://cellphones.com.vn/macbook-pro-14-inch-m4-16gb-512gb.html",
  "image": "https://cdn2.cellphones.com.vn/.../macbook_4__7.png"
}
```

### Data We Can Extract (When Scraping Works):
- ✅ **Model Name** - Full product name with specs
- ✅ **Configuration** - CPU/GPU cores, RAM, storage (embedded in name)
- ✅ **Price (VND)** - Numeric pricing
- ✅ **Product URL** - Direct link to product page
- ✅ **Product Images** - MacBook product photos
- ✅ **Availability** - In stock vs out of stock status
- ⚠️ **Specifications** - Requires parsing product name or visiting detail page
- ❌ **VAT Information** - Not typically shown
- ❌ **Release Date** - Not shown in listings

### Data We CANNOT Easily Get:
- Separated CPU core count (mixed in product name)
- Separated GPU core count (mixed in product name)
- Separated RAM amount (mixed in product name)
- Separated storage capacity (mixed in product name)
- Historical price data
- Real-time stock levels (only current status)

## Recommended Data Collection Strategy

### Option 1: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Phase 1: Automated Scraping (Where Possible)**
- ✅ **CellphoneS**: Use simple requests + BeautifulSoup
- ✅ **ShopDunk**: Use Playwright with extended timeouts
- Duration: 1-2 days development + testing

**Phase 2: Manual Entry (For Blocked Sites)**
- ⚠️ **FPT Shop**: Manual entry of ~35 popular models
- ⚠️ **TopZone**: Manual entry of ~35 popular models
- Duration: 4-6 hours (with copy-paste helper script)

**Total Time:** 2-3 days
**Coverage:** 100% of needed data
**Maintenance:** Semi-automated (scraping runs weekly, manual updates quarterly)

### Option 2: Fully Manual Entry

- Manually visit all 4 sites
- Copy-paste data into structured JSON/CSV
- Use browser DevTools to extract data
- Duration: 8-12 hours for ~150 models × 4 shops = 600 data points
- Maintenance: Fully manual (time-consuming)

### Option 3: Advanced Scraping (Not Recommended)

- Implement rotating proxies
- Use undetected-chromedriver
- CAPTCHA solving services ($$$)
- Risk of IP bans
- Duration: 1-2 weeks development
- Maintenance: Fragile, requires constant updates

## Implementation Plan (Hybrid Approach)

### Week 1: Automated Scraping

**Day 1-2: CellphoneS Scraper**
```python
# Simple scraper works!
- Scrape MacBook Pro page
- Scrape MacBook Air page
- Parse product names for specs
- Extract prices, URLs, images
- Save to JSON
```

**Day 3-4: ShopDunk Scraper**
```python
# Playwright-based scraper
- Increase timeout to 60s
- Add retry logic (3 attempts)
- Better price extraction (handle discount %, special-price class)
- Filter out refurbished products (or mark them)
- Save to JSON
```

**Day 5: Testing & Validation**
- Compare scraped data with manual spot checks
- Validate price formats
- Check for missing models
- Document scraping intervals (daily? weekly?)

### Week 2: Manual Data Entry

**Day 1-2: FPT Shop Manual Entry**
- Create structured spreadsheet template
- Copy-paste 35 most popular models
- Include: Model, Price, URL, Availability
- Script to convert CSV → JSON for app

**Day 3-4: TopZone Manual Entry**
- Same process as FPT Shop
- Focus on models not available elsewhere
- Verify pricing accuracy

**Day 5: Integration & Testing**
- Merge all data sources (scraped + manual)
- Update API route.js with complete dataset
- Test UI with full 150+ models
- Deploy to production

---

## Data Structure Requirements

### Current Structure (from route.js)
```javascript
{
  id: "m4-air-13-16-256",
  model: 'MacBook Air 13"',
  modelType: "MacBook Air",
  screenSize: '13"',
  category: "M4",
  configuration: "M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB, 256GB",
  vndPrice: 25090000,
  fptUrl: "https://...",
  available: true,
}
```

### Required Parsing (from scraped names)
Example scraped name:  
`"MacBook Pro 14 M4 10CPU 10GPU 16GB 512GB | Chính hãng Apple Việt Nam"`

**Needs to extract:**
- Model: "MacBook Pro 14\""
- Category: "M4"
- CPU: 10 cores
- GPU: 10 cores
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: 512GB

**Regex patterns needed:**
```python
chip_pattern = r'(M1|M2|M3|M4|M4 Pro|M4 Max|M3 Pro|M3 Max)'
cpu_pattern = r'(\d+)\s*CPU|(\d+)[-\s]*core CPU'
gpu_pattern = r'(\d+)\s*GPU|(\d+)[-\s]*core GPU'
ram_pattern = r'(\d+)\s*GB(?!\s*SSD)'
storage_pattern = r'(\d+)\s*GB\s*SSD|(\d+)\s*TB'
screen_pattern = r'(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*inch|(\d+)"'
```

## Scraper Maintenance Plan

### Automated Scrapers (CellphoneS + ShopDunk)
- **Frequency:** Run daily at 2 AM Vietnam time
- **Storage:** Save to MongoDB with timestamp
- **Monitoring:** Alert if scrape fails 3 days in a row
- **Updates:** Review selectors quarterly (when sites redesign)

### Manual Entry (FPT Shop + TopZone)
- **Frequency:** Update monthly OR when new models launch
- **Process:** 
  1. Check for new MacBook releases
  2. Visit FPT/TopZone sites
  3. Update CSV template
  4. Run conversion script
  5. Deploy updated JSON
- **Time Required:** ~2 hours/month

## Missing Models Priority List

Based on scraping test, here are models we should prioritize:

### High Priority (Popular Configurations)
1. **M2 Air 13"** - 8GB, 512GB ← CellphoneS likely has this
2. **M3 Air 13"** - 16GB, 512GB ← ShopDunk confirmed
3. **M4 Air 13"** - 16GB, 1TB ← Check all shops manually
4. **M4 Pro 14"** - 24GB, 1TB ← CellphoneS likely has this
5. **M4 Pro 16"** - 48GB, 1TB ← Manual entry needed

### Medium Priority (Less Common But Available)
6-20. Various M2/M3 Air 15" configurations
21-30. M3 Pro 14"/16" models (likely not in stock)

### Low Priority (Rare/Expensive)
31-50. High-end M4 Max configs (64GB, 96GB, 128GB RAM)
